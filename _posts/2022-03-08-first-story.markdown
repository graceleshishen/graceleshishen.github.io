“Well, for sure,” said Mom. “There is a few chocolate coated spoon that you two can lick.”

Janice and Becki slide into their aprons. Janice’s apron has a small vine with some purple flowers. Becki’s has a girl sitting on the moon. 

Pounder, milk and sugar mix mix mix! When the cookies were set to bake,Janice and Becki started for Janice’s treehouse in the garden.

”Let us play pioneer’s day in the treehouse.” Janice suggested. 

“ I will be called Katie in this game,” said Becki. 

“Then I will be called Bella” Janice called. 

Janice has a sucer and tea cup set. There is also a table and two blue chairs in the treehouse. Janice’s neighbor, Mrs. Remen, whose children have all grown up, gave Janice a toy cooking set before too. It was like living in a house there. After a while of this game, Janice and Becki asked if they could go to the playground. 

“Just come back in time for dinner” Mom told them. 

The two girls started for the park. When Janice and Becki arrived they were surprised to their friend Kelly at there too. 

“ Hi Kelly, do you want to play the monkey bar with us?” asked Janice. 

“Sure” she answered. 

While they were climbing Kelly told them “There was a new neighbor who moved to the house beside ours. There is a girl. She was from Japan. And she have a lot of beautiful sumiko. She told me that she will be coming to our school! The only problem is that she was quiet shy so she only talk to me when she was not shy.” 

“ Wow, a new girl? Maybe we should give them a welcome party?” Becki couldn’t help but shouted. 

“Always ask a grownup for such big idea.” Janice thought out loud. 

Soon they decided to play the slide and swing. “Becki and I are having a slumber party.” Jance explained. 

“I wish I could be there.”said Kelly. 

Soon it was time to go home. “Will you and Becki set the dishes for me?” asked Mom. After a delicious dinner of spaghetti and salmon mom asked if Janice and Becki would want to watch a movie on the tv. 

“Can we watch the new movie about Helen Keller?” Janice asked Mom. 

“Oh, OH, It is the one just filmed for kids.” Becki added.

 “Why not,” Mom answered. “Let’s see if it is in our movie bundle.”Mom said while taking the tv control. Sure enough, it is. 

That was the best movie I’ve ever watched” Becki praised. 

Later, it was bath time so they headed to the washroom and had a great water fight. 

“Where do you want to sleep? In my bed or in the sleeping bag?”Janice asked Becki. 

“I think I’ll sleep in the sleeping bed.” Becki said. At last, they were all snuggled in bed.    
               
The next morning when Mrs. Brown took Becki home, she was burst of excitement to tell her mom. 

### The New Girl

Monday morning arrived and Janice was changing and Melanie was helping her with her ribbon,the school bus beeped. 

“There is no time.” Janice shouted. 

Melanie and her snatch there lunch box and school bag then ran out. 

“Guess who you’ll be seeing at the next stop?” Becki and some other friends asked her. 

“The Japanese girl.” Janice answered questionly. 

“Yup,it is her!”Becki answered. 

Soon they come to the next stop and the new girl arrived.She have totally dark hair and a beautiful red costume with tiny peach flower on it. She stare at the bus then slowly step on. Then she stare at every one. 

Janice’s friend Hannah was the first to broke the silence with a sneeze.Quickly,Becki take over by saying “Welcome, take a seat.” She carefully seated on a chair beside Janice. 

Being friendly, Janice took her hand. “I am Janice.What is your name? Kelly told me about you before and we're all excited to see you. And I love your dress.”Janice said with a long breath. 

Finally the girl give a smile and whisper to Janice, “I am Arika.” Being a little envious about the new girl talking first to Janice, Becki said, “And I am Becki. Of course you know this is Kelly. And that was Hannah,Emily,Faith,and Anne.” 

Soon they arrived and step of. Arika followed Becki and Janice into the school.Then Janice’s friend step beside them and introduces herself to Arika. 

Soon, they arrived at their classroom.Miss Chessauri, Janice’s teacher seems to know that Arika is coming.Akira found a seat with her name on it and sit down.

When the lesson started,Miss Chessauri called Arika to the front and introduced her to the class.Arika was so concentrated in the lesson that she didn’t even realize it was time to have lunch. 

“I'll show you where the cafe is.”Janice told Arika. 

“Thanks!”she said.

Janice took a tray and table ware.Then she showed Arika where the line was waiting for lunch.They had potatoes, broccoli, fried chicken, and peach juice for lunch. After lunch and a few more lessons, it was time to go home. “It was nice to meet you.” said Janice. 

### Swimming

It was a hot summer afternoon, and Emily called to Janice if she wants to go swimming with them. “Of Course! Will Becki be coming?” Janice answered. “Yes, she will!” Emily called back. No sooner did Emily arrive at Janice’s house and pick her up for the swimming pool.On their way, they pick Becki too! When they arrived it was quite crowded since it was a hot day and everyone wanted to swim. They first have a shower then jump right into the pool.Janice and Emily already know how to swim so they teach Becki. “I can’t do it! Stop holding me.”Becki would shout. They swim all the way till dawn and they must go home.The cool breeze fell on their face. “What a nice day God has given us” Janice said.Mom was waiting at the front door for Janice and so was Malenie.

### Camping

One afternoon when Janice was playing soccer with Melanie in the garden, Janice’s dad drove back from his company. 

“Do you two wanna go camping?” Dad asked. 

Mom scratched her head and said “Are you sure this is a good idea?”Mom glanced at Dad with a silly wriggle in her eye.

 “Well eh, if you don't go then you won’t know what will happen.”Dad said with a nervous laugh. 

“Alright,”Mom said as she turned back into the house. Janice and Melanie screamed and laughed for you gotta know this is their first time. 

That night Mom let Janice and Melanie help pack up. 

“Do we need toothbrushes?” Malenie asked. 

“Not really, too much stuff on a camping trip isn’t so good.” Mom answered with a bundle of sleeping bags in her arm. 

The next day Dad loads everything onto the car. Finally they were all settled in the car and drove off the small road. 

When they got on the highway Melanie’s stomach began to growl. It was so loud that Dad couldn't help but laugh. Mom was always prepared and gave Melanie and Janice each a homemade bacon bread. Soon after they got off the highway Janice and Melanie began to see cows and woods. Dad made a small turn and they stopped. 

Janice glanced at Mom in her seat. “We’re here!” Dad answered for Mom who shut her mouth tight.

 “Yup, when Melanie wasn’t even born we came here.” Mom said as she checked the surroundings. 

“Who wants to build the tents?” Dad said. 

Janice and Melanie give each other a stare and both call, “I will!” But when they two began it was found out not to be so easy. “

You two were a little bit too young. Let me show you.” Dad said with a joking voice. 

Somehow, it turns out that the tents fall on Dad’s head. “I’ll look at the instructions if I were you.” Mom said after a few attempts failed. 

Finally, when the tents were done Dad started to make some barbecue. This time the smell of sausages made Janice's stomach growl. When the foods were fully cooked and Mom had made some canned cheesy potatoes and bean soup, the family spread the picnic mat and sat down to eat. 

“This is the best food I ever have!”Melanie exclaimed.

 “I wonder where these soups were buyed. Best I ever had.”Janice said. 

Mom gave Dad a smile and Dad returned it by saying, “I suggest we play Guess what is on Your Head.”

It was mom’s favorite game. The first step is that everyone wrote something on a piece of paper. Then, they stick it on someone else's head. When it is your turn you can ask a question like “is this thing on my head an animal?” 

Next, the other people will answer you yes or no. Everyone takes turns to ask in a circle. Janice sticks on Melanie’s head “Avatar” while Melanie sticks 

“The Story of My Life by Helen Keller '' on Mom’s head. 

Mom sticks “ballet shoes” on Janice’s head so Dad can only stick his, which is “Jingle Bells” on Melanie’s head. 

The first one to answer the thing on their head will win. Well guess who wins? It was Janice.  

That afternoon, Dad took everyone into the woods. Janice has a nature journal that she wants to add. Melanie has a rock and leaves collection that is never enough. 

Melanie found a smooth obsidian which she adds to her collection. Janice found a lot of leaves to make name cards. Mom also collects some pine cones to make a picture frame. Well, Dad gets a large piece of limestone. Finally, the family gets back to the tent area where Mom makes some dinner. 

As they sat around the fire that night, Dad told a story about him as a boy. “It was a windy morning when I went fishing with your grandpa. I couldn't be more happy when I caught a fine trout. But, before I could open my eyes from laughing, the trout was blown off my hook! Your grandpa didn't want me to quit so he held my hand with the hook between it. Then after an hour or so I caught an even bigger trout! This time before I laughed I was sure it was safely held in my hand. I ran off twice the speed I came to ask your grandma to make it into my favorit soup for dinner.” 

Mom took the seat beside Dad and said, “Talking about soup, I think we can have some real ones.” 

Mom scoop out fully cooked soup and salmon for dinner. After dinner Mom said good night to the girls and took the lamp away. Whoosh,flop flop flop, Mom came running to the tent. 

“The wind was blowing hard, you two came out of the tent, it was about to be blown off.” Mom panted as she shouted in the wind.

 Janice and Melanie bustled into their coats and pulled up their boots. Many campers were shouting and hurring about at their campsites too. Janice’s nose was blown pink and Melanie’s coat was about to be blown off if it wasn’t for Mom to catch it. 

Mom took out the flashlight then called Dad to get some mittens for Janice and Melanie. 

“I guess you may know a story.” Dad said.

 “Last time your mom and I came here, it was a windy night as well. Our stuff was blown all over the place and it took us a whole day to pick them up and set them to their spot. That was probably why your mom didn’t want you to bring too many things {such as toothbrushes}.” 

The wind went away the next morning when mom was making breakfast. When they were ready to go, each one of them shared a smile to remember this windy, tasty, and fun trip.

### Cod Cody

One day after school, Janice and Melanie were surprised to see Mom and Dad waiting for them at the school’s doorway. Janice couldn’t tell whether Mom was happy or sad, but she was sure Dad was extremely excited. Mom was having a tummy ache for a few days so that morning Mom went to the hospital for a check up. Janice was sure it was about something that happens at the hospital. 

“What was going on?” Melanie asked. 

“You’ll see.”Mom answered cheerfully. 

Janice felt much better with Mom’s cheerful sound. When they got into the car, Mom gave Dad a smile and they said together, “You are going to have a little brother!” Janice’s mouth went wide open. 

“Is that why Mom was having a tummy ache?” Malenie asked. “Yup”Dad answered as he put his arm around Mom. 

The next day was Saturday so Mom took Janice and Melanie on a shopping trip to buy supplies for the new baby. They go to a shop full of baby supplies. 

“What do we need?” Melanie asked. 

“Here is a list.” Mom answered. 

There were diapers,bottles,clothes,towels,toys,socks,cart,tissue,shampoo and body wash,skin protect oil,washing tub,milk powder,...... Melanie and Janice each take a small “gulp” because they were all amazed at how much a baby needs. 

After they completed their shopping Mom drove straight back home. Mom simply stuck some pizzas in the oven then started toward a small but comfortable room on the second floor. It was separated from the master bedroom by a wall with a doorway inside the master bedroom. 

When Mom and Dad bought that house it was saved for any new baby to sleep in. Janice and Melanie each slept in that bedroom before they moved to the bedroom they now slept in. Mom takes a good look at the room then walks back down the stairs to take out the pizzas. Mom made an announcement after dinner. 

“I think it was time for us to plan the bedroom for the baby.” The bedroom? Janice and Melanie didn’t remember about the bedroom. 

“You two all slept in that room before and now we are suppose to give it new paint,decorations,furnitures,and fill it with baby supplies.” Dad explained. 

“When are we going to buy all that and besides where are we going to buy all that?” Melanie asked. “Are you asking a bunch of adjective questions?” Mom asked.

 “Now, tomorrow we can go to some shops after church and your mom knows exactly where they are.” Dad said. 

The next morning Janice put on a dark green, laced dress and Melanie simply wore her yellow flower dress. They got to church and Janice met Becki at Sunday school too. 

“I am going to have a little brother!” said Janice. 

“Wow, did you think of a name for it?” Becki asked. 

Janice have never thought of this question before. “Nope, but I think Matt would be a nice name.” Janice answered as she realized she never even really heard this question from her parents either. 

After church Dad drove the family to somewhere named “Baby Decor” where Mom give the girls a smile. Mom seems to be a little tired, but just as usually Dad park the car and they got off. 

Mom took a shopping cart and turned to the girls, “How would you like to pick a kind of blue paint for the wall?” 

“We choose?” Janice and Melanie almost asked at the same time. 

“Ya, why not. because Melanie was too small when you were born so she can’t choose a color for you.” Mom answered. 

Janice and Melanie were fascinated by the different blue to choose. In the end they choose a kind of deep sea blue for the room. Mom also chooses a few decorations, but not much since they can make some themself. After they got home, Mom took out some newspaper that she stored up to cover the floor near the wall. 

They took out the big cans of paint. Dad paints most of the wall while Janice and Melanie help with the easy part. That night the family gathered around the dining room, Mom took out pieces of yellow foam paper. 

“Let's make some stars to hang on a string then put the string of stars hanging on the wall.” Mom suggested. 

Janice wants to do the folding part. Dad cut and knotted some strings. Melanie glues the stars while Mom punches holes in the stars to put the string through. Soon the stars were ready so Dad hamered a few nails in the wall and Mom hung the stars up. 

Then, they put a moon shaped lamp on the nightstand. The next day was Monday so Melanie and Janice had to go to school. Janice’s friends Annie and Becki come to Janice’s house to play.

 “Hello Mrs. Gilford, I heard Janice say that you were going to have a new baby!” Becki said. 

“Can we do anything to help?” Annie asked. 

“Thank you, well I do need some help with hanging the baby’s clothings.” Mom answered. 

There is  a little closet at the right side of the bedroom where all the baby clothings was hung. Seeing Becki hanging the coat Janice remembered, “We haven’t named the baby yet, Mom.”

 “Oh ya, I totally forgot with all this cleaning to do.” Mom said suddenly remembering. 

“We will have to ask your Dad and Melanie’s opinions too” Mom told Janice. 

A Few Month Later……  One day when Mom goes to check up, the doctor suggests that Mom stay in the hospital until the baby is born. Since Mom choose to stay, Janice’s aunt, aunt Juliana comes to stay so that she can help Mom and cook food for the others at home. Janice’s grandparents from her mom’s side lived in a city that was a little far from Janice’s house in Palatka,Florida so they came to stay too. Janice Grandparents from her Dad’s side live only a few streets from their house so they can come anytime if needed. 

One Saturday while Janice, Melanie,Dad, and Aunt Juliana were at church, a call came to tell them that the baby was about to be born! They quickly started driving toward the hospital. When they arrived, they were told to sit outside the room and wait for the baby. 

Dad walked back and forth and so was Melanie. Aunt Juliana hurried to the room that Mom and the new baby were to stay in for a few days and do the best she can to make it comfortable and warm. Janice was simply sitting there waiting for her brother. 

After a quick hour flew by, Mom and the baby came out. Mom had a big smile on her face and the baby was all wrapped up in blankets and was as peaceful as it could be. When Mom was strong enough and so was the baby after staying in the hospital for a few days they both came home. 

Now, there was only one problem, sometimes in the night the baby’s cry would make Janice awake and Melanie would flip on her bed while she was about to be asleep. But no matter what, it was a cute little brother all the time. The baby’s first word was ma ma of course, but after a while it started to say Melanie which meant Melanie and Ja ice which meant Janice. Somehow, Mom forgot to buy enough milk powder one day so she made a no bong cod and milk soup that was ground up for the baby. He drank so happily and nearly drank up all the soup Mom made. It was sure that he likes cod. 

That day after Dad got home from his work, Mom called Janice and Melanie and Dad together to discuss an important thing. “What do you guys think would be a nice name for the baby?” she asked. 

Janice says Matt like she told Becki and Melanie want him to be called Samuel while Dad thinks William would be nice. Mom shared the story about how their baby loves cod. Then she said, “I think since he likes cod, why not call him Cody?” Everyone agrees on this name so the baby will now be little Cody.

### Farm

Janice and Melanie’s grandparents from her mom side have a farm that is two and a half hours from Janice's house. They would sometimes go for a visit on Saturday. 

Today, they will be going to the farm. “Mom, may my friend Charlotte come too?” Melanie asked.

 “I’m sure it will be fine. Where did she live?” Mom answered. 

“Oh, I never asked her that before. But I do remember her mentioning that she lives somewhere in Palm Valley.” Janice wanted to ask Mom if Becki could come, but as soon as she opened her mouth Mom said, “I know you want Becki to come, but if Charlotte was to come there won’t be any seat in the car for her.” 

Anyway, Janice was glad to visit her grandparents. When they get into the car, Cody sleeps on Mom’s knee while Dad drives the car and Charlotte, Melanie, and Janice will sit at the back. When Mom arrived at Charlotte’s home which Melanie found out to be 184, Charlotte was right at the door. “I thought you would be coming soon. I got you a new best friend bracelet.” Charlotte said as she came rushing forward.
