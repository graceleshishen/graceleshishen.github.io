I"P<p>â€œWell, for sure,â€ said Mom. â€œThere is a few chocolate coated spoon that you two can lick.â€</p>

<p>Janice and Becki slide into their aprons. Janiceâ€™s apron has a small vine with some purple flowers. Beckiâ€™s has a girl sitting on the moon.</p>

<p>Pounder, milk and sugar mix mix mix! When the cookies were set to bake,Janice and Becki started for Janiceâ€™s treehouse in the garden.</p>

<p>â€Let us play pioneerâ€™s day in the treehouse.â€ Janice suggested.</p>

<p>â€œ I will be called Katie in this game,â€ said Becki.</p>

<p>â€œThen I will be called Bellaâ€ Janice called.</p>

<p>Janice has a sucer and tea cup set. There is also a table and two blue chairs in the treehouse. Janiceâ€™s neighbor, Mrs. Remen, whose children have all grown up, gave Janice a toy cooking set before too. It was like living in a house there. After a while of this game, Janice and Becki asked if they could go to the playground.</p>

<p>â€œJust come back in time for dinnerâ€ Mom told them.</p>

<p>The two girls started for the park. When Janice and Becki arrived they were surprised to their friend Kelly at there too.</p>

<p>â€œ Hi Kelly, do you want to play the monkey bar with us?â€ asked Janice.</p>

<p>â€œSureâ€ she answered.</p>

<p>While they were climbing Kelly told them â€œThere was a new neighbor who moved to the house beside ours. There is a girl. She was from Japan. And she have a lot of beautiful sumiko. She told me that she will be coming to our school! The only problem is that she was quiet shy so she only talk to me when she was not shy.â€</p>

<p>â€œ Wow, a new girl? Maybe we should give them a welcome party?â€ Becki couldnâ€™t help but shouted.</p>

<p>â€œAlways ask a grownup for such big idea.â€ Janice thought out loud.</p>

<p>Soon they decided to play the slide and swing. â€œBecki and I are having a slumber party.â€ Jance explained.</p>

<p>â€œI wish I could be there.â€said Kelly.</p>

<p>Soon it was time to go home. â€œWill you and Becki set the dishes for me?â€ asked Mom. After a delicious dinner of spaghetti and salmon mom asked if Janice and Becki would want to watch a movie on the tv.</p>

<p>â€œCan we watch the new movie about Helen Keller?â€ Janice asked Mom.</p>

<p>â€œOh, OH, It is the one just filmed for kids.â€ Becki added.</p>

<p>â€œWhy not,â€ Mom answered. â€œLetâ€™s see if it is in our movie bundle.â€Mom said while taking the tv control. Sure enough, it is.</p>

<p>That was the best movie Iâ€™ve ever watchedâ€ Becki praised.</p>

<p>Later, it was bath time so they headed to the washroom and had a great water fight.</p>

<p>â€œWhere do you want to sleep? In my bed or in the sleeping bag?â€Janice asked Becki.</p>

<p>â€œI think Iâ€™ll sleep in the sleeping bed.â€ Becki said. At last, they were all snuggled in bed.</p>

<p>The next morning when Mrs. Brown took Becki home, she was burst of excitement to tell her mom.</p>

<h3 id="the-new-girl">The New Girl</h3>

<p>Monday morning arrived and Janice was changing and Melanie was helping her with her ribbon,the school bus beeped.</p>

<p>â€œThere is no time.â€ Janice shouted.</p>

<p>Melanie and her snatch there lunch box and school bag then ran out.</p>

<p>â€œGuess who youâ€™ll be seeing at the next stop?â€ Becki and some other friends asked her.</p>

<p>â€œThe Japanese girl.â€ Janice answered questionly.</p>

<p>â€œYup,it is her!â€Becki answered.</p>

<p>Soon they come to the next stop and the new girl arrived.She have totally dark hair and a beautiful red costume with tiny peach flower on it. She stare at the bus then slowly step on. Then she stare at every one.</p>

<p>Janiceâ€™s friend Hannah was the first to broke the silence with a sneeze.Quickly,Becki take over by saying â€œWelcome, take a seat.â€ She carefully seated on a chair beside Janice.</p>

<p>Being friendly, Janice took her hand. â€œI am Janice.What is your name? Kelly told me about you before and weâ€™re all excited to see you. And I love your dress.â€Janice said with a long breath.</p>

<p>Finally the girl give a smile and whisper to Janice, â€œI am Arika.â€ Being a little envious about the new girl talking first to Janice, Becki said, â€œAnd I am Becki. Of course you know this is Kelly. And that was Hannah,Emily,Faith,and Anne.â€</p>

<p>Soon they arrived and step of. Arika followed Becki and Janice into the school.Then Janiceâ€™s friend step beside them and introduces herself to Arika.</p>

<p>Soon, they arrived at their classroom.Miss Chessauri, Janiceâ€™s teacher seems to know that Arika is coming.Akira found a seat with her name on it and sit down.</p>

<p>When the lesson started,Miss Chessauri called Arika to the front and introduced her to the class.Arika was so concentrated in the lesson that she didnâ€™t even realize it was time to have lunch.</p>

<p>â€œIâ€™ll show you where the cafe is.â€Janice told Arika.</p>

<p>â€œThanks!â€she said.</p>

<p>Janice took a tray and table ware.Then she showed Arika where the line was waiting for lunch.They had potatoes, broccoli, fried chicken, and peach juice for lunch. After lunch and a few more lessons, it was time to go home. â€œIt was nice to meet you.â€ said Janice.</p>

<h3 id="swimming">Swimming</h3>

<p>It was a hot summer afternoon, and Emily called to Janice if she wants to go swimming with them. â€œOf Course! Will Becki be coming?â€ Janice answered. â€œYes, she will!â€ Emily called back. No sooner did Emily arrive at Janiceâ€™s house and pick her up for the swimming pool.On their way, they pick Becki too! When they arrived it was quite crowded since it was a hot day and everyone wanted to swim. They first have a shower then jump right into the pool.Janice and Emily already know how to swim so they teach Becki. â€œI canâ€™t do it! Stop holding me.â€Becki would shout. They swim all the way till dawn and they must go home.The cool breeze fell on their face. â€œWhat a nice day God has given usâ€ Janice said.Mom was waiting at the front door for Janice and so was Malenie.</p>

<h3 id="camping">Camping</h3>

<p>One afternoon when Janice was playing soccer with Melanie in the garden, Janiceâ€™s dad drove back from his company.</p>

<p>â€œDo you two wanna go camping?â€ Dad asked.</p>

<p>Mom scratched her head and said â€œAre you sure this is a good idea?â€Mom glanced at Dad with a silly wriggle in her eye.</p>

<p>â€œWell eh, if you donâ€™t go then you wonâ€™t know what will happen.â€Dad said with a nervous laugh.</p>

<p>â€œAlright,â€Mom said as she turned back into the house. Janice and Melanie screamed and laughed for you gotta know this is their first time.</p>

<p>That night Mom let Janice and Melanie help pack up.</p>

<p>â€œDo we need toothbrushes?â€ Malenie asked.</p>

<p>â€œNot really, too much stuff on a camping trip isnâ€™t so good.â€ Mom answered with a bundle of sleeping bags in her arm.</p>

<p>The next day Dad loads everything onto the car. Finally they were all settled in the car and drove off the small road.</p>

<p>When they got on the highway Melanieâ€™s stomach began to growl. It was so loud that Dad couldnâ€™t help but laugh. Mom was always prepared and gave Melanie and Janice each a homemade bacon bread. Soon after they got off the highway Janice and Melanie began to see cows and woods. Dad made a small turn and they stopped.</p>

<p>Janice glanced at Mom in her seat. â€œWeâ€™re here!â€ Dad answered for Mom who shut her mouth tight.</p>

<p>â€œYup, when Melanie wasnâ€™t even born we came here.â€ Mom said as she checked the surroundings.</p>

<p>â€œWho wants to build the tents?â€ Dad said.</p>

<p>Janice and Melanie give each other a stare and both call, â€œI will!â€ But when they two began it was found out not to be so easy. â€œ</p>

<p>You two were a little bit too young. Let me show you.â€ Dad said with a joking voice.</p>

<p>Somehow, it turns out that the tents fall on Dadâ€™s head. â€œIâ€™ll look at the instructions if I were you.â€ Mom said after a few attempts failed.</p>

<p>Finally, when the tents were done Dad started to make some barbecue. This time the smell of sausages made Janiceâ€™s stomach growl. When the foods were fully cooked and Mom had made some canned cheesy potatoes and bean soup, the family spread the picnic mat and sat down to eat.</p>

<p>â€œThis is the best food I ever have!â€Melanie exclaimed.</p>

<p>â€œI wonder where these soups were buyed. Best I ever had.â€Janice said.</p>

<p>Mom gave Dad a smile and Dad returned it by saying, â€œI suggest we play Guess what is on Your Head.â€</p>

<p>It was momâ€™s favorite game. The first step is that everyone wrote something on a piece of paper. Then, they stick it on someone elseâ€™s head. When it is your turn you can ask a question like â€œis this thing on my head an animal?â€</p>

<p>Next, the other people will answer you yes or no. Everyone takes turns to ask in a circle. Janice sticks on Melanieâ€™s head â€œAvatarâ€ while Melanie sticks</p>

<p>â€œThe Story of My Life by Helen Keller â€˜â€™ on Momâ€™s head.</p>

<p>Mom sticks â€œballet shoesâ€ on Janiceâ€™s head so Dad can only stick his, which is â€œJingle Bellsâ€ on Melanieâ€™s head.</p>

<p>The first one to answer the thing on their head will win. Well guess who wins? It was Janice.</p>

<p>That afternoon, Dad took everyone into the woods. Janice has a nature journal that she wants to add. Melanie has a rock and leaves collection that is never enough.</p>

<p>Melanie found a smooth obsidian which she adds to her collection. Janice found a lot of leaves to make name cards. Mom also collects some pine cones to make a picture frame. Well, Dad gets a large piece of limestone. Finally, the family gets back to the tent area where Mom makes some dinner.</p>

<p>As they sat around the fire that night, Dad told a story about him as a boy. â€œIt was a windy morning when I went fishing with your grandpa. I couldnâ€™t be more happy when I caught a fine trout. But, before I could open my eyes from laughing, the trout was blown off my hook! Your grandpa didnâ€™t want me to quit so he held my hand with the hook between it. Then after an hour or so I caught an even bigger trout! This time before I laughed I was sure it was safely held in my hand. I ran off twice the speed I came to ask your grandma to make it into my favorit soup for dinner.â€</p>

<p>Mom took the seat beside Dad and said, â€œTalking about soup, I think we can have some real ones.â€</p>

<p>Mom scoop out fully cooked soup and salmon for dinner. After dinner Mom said good night to the girls and took the lamp away. Whoosh,flop flop flop, Mom came running to the tent.</p>

<p>â€œThe wind was blowing hard, you two came out of the tent, it was about to be blown off.â€ Mom panted as she shouted in the wind.</p>

<p>Janice and Melanie bustled into their coats and pulled up their boots. Many campers were shouting and hurring about at their campsites too. Janiceâ€™s nose was blown pink and Melanieâ€™s coat was about to be blown off if it wasnâ€™t for Mom to catch it.</p>

<p>Mom took out the flashlight then called Dad to get some mittens for Janice and Melanie.</p>

<p>â€œI guess you may know a story.â€ Dad said.</p>

<p>â€œLast time your mom and I came here, it was a windy night as well. Our stuff was blown all over the place and it took us a whole day to pick them up and set them to their spot. That was probably why your mom didnâ€™t want you to bring too many things {such as toothbrushes}.â€</p>

<p>The wind went away the next morning when mom was making breakfast. When they were ready to go, each one of them shared a smile to remember this windy, tasty, and fun trip.</p>

<h3 id="cod-cody">Cod Cody</h3>

<p>One day after school, Janice and Melanie were surprised to see Mom and Dad waiting for them at the schoolâ€™s doorway. Janice couldnâ€™t tell whether Mom was happy or sad, but she was sure Dad was extremely excited. Mom was having a tummy ache for a few days so that morning Mom went to the hospital for a check up. Janice was sure it was about something that happens at the hospital.</p>

<p>â€œWhat was going on?â€ Melanie asked.</p>

<p>â€œYouâ€™ll see.â€Mom answered cheerfully.</p>

<p>Janice felt much better with Momâ€™s cheerful sound. When they got into the car, Mom gave Dad a smile and they said together, â€œYou are going to have a little brother!â€ Janiceâ€™s mouth went wide open.</p>

<p>â€œIs that why Mom was having a tummy ache?â€ Malenie asked. â€œYupâ€Dad answered as he put his arm around Mom.</p>

<p>The next day was Saturday so Mom took Janice and Melanie on a shopping trip to buy supplies for the new baby. They go to a shop full of baby supplies.</p>

<p>â€œWhat do we need?â€ Melanie asked.</p>

<p>â€œHere is a list.â€ Mom answered.</p>

<p>There were diapers,bottles,clothes,towels,toys,socks,cart,tissue,shampoo and body wash,skin protect oil,washing tub,milk powder,â€¦â€¦ Melanie and Janice each take a small â€œgulpâ€ because they were all amazed at how much a baby needs.</p>

<p>After they completed their shopping Mom drove straight back home. Mom simply stuck some pizzas in the oven then started toward a small but comfortable room on the second floor. It was separated from the master bedroom by a wall with a doorway inside the master bedroom.</p>

<p>When Mom and Dad bought that house it was saved for any new baby to sleep in. Janice and Melanie each slept in that bedroom before they moved to the bedroom they now slept in. Mom takes a good look at the room then walks back down the stairs to take out the pizzas. Mom made an announcement after dinner.</p>

<p>â€œI think it was time for us to plan the bedroom for the baby.â€ The bedroom? Janice and Melanie didnâ€™t remember about the bedroom.</p>

<p>â€œYou two all slept in that room before and now we are suppose to give it new paint,decorations,furnitures,and fill it with baby supplies.â€ Dad explained.</p>

<p>â€œWhen are we going to buy all that and besides where are we going to buy all that?â€ Melanie asked. â€œAre you asking a bunch of adjective questions?â€ Mom asked.</p>

<p>â€œNow, tomorrow we can go to some shops after church and your mom knows exactly where they are.â€ Dad said.</p>

<p>The next morning Janice put on a dark green, laced dress and Melanie simply wore her yellow flower dress. They got to church and Janice met Becki at Sunday school too.</p>

<p>â€œI am going to have a little brother!â€ said Janice.</p>

<p>â€œWow, did you think of a name for it?â€ Becki asked.</p>

<p>Janice have never thought of this question before. â€œNope, but I think Matt would be a nice name.â€ Janice answered as she realized she never even really heard this question from her parents either.</p>

<p>After church Dad drove the family to somewhere named â€œBaby Decorâ€ where Mom give the girls a smile. Mom seems to be a little tired, but just as usually Dad park the car and they got off.</p>

<p>Mom took a shopping cart and turned to the girls, â€œHow would you like to pick a kind of blue paint for the wall?â€</p>

<p>â€œWe choose?â€ Janice and Melanie almost asked at the same time.</p>

<p>â€œYa, why not. because Melanie was too small when you were born so she canâ€™t choose a color for you.â€ Mom answered.</p>

<p>Janice and Melanie were fascinated by the different blue to choose. In the end they choose a kind of deep sea blue for the room. Mom also chooses a few decorations, but not much since they can make some themself. After they got home, Mom took out some newspaper that she stored up to cover the floor near the wall.</p>

<p>They took out the big cans of paint. Dad paints most of the wall while Janice and Melanie help with the easy part. That night the family gathered around the dining room, Mom took out pieces of yellow foam paper.</p>

<p>â€œLetâ€™s make some stars to hang on a string then put the string of stars hanging on the wall.â€ Mom suggested.</p>

<p>Janice wants to do the folding part. Dad cut and knotted some strings. Melanie glues the stars while Mom punches holes in the stars to put the string through. Soon the stars were ready so Dad hamered a few nails in the wall and Mom hung the stars up.</p>

<p>Then, they put a moon shaped lamp on the nightstand. The next day was Monday so Melanie and Janice had to go to school. Janiceâ€™s friends Annie and Becki come to Janiceâ€™s house to play.</p>

<p>â€œHello Mrs. Gilford, I heard Janice say that you were going to have a new baby!â€ Becki said.</p>

<p>â€œCan we do anything to help?â€ Annie asked.</p>

<p>â€œThank you, well I do need some help with hanging the babyâ€™s clothings.â€ Mom answered.</p>

<p>There is  a little closet at the right side of the bedroom where all the baby clothings was hung. Seeing Becki hanging the coat Janice remembered, â€œWe havenâ€™t named the baby yet, Mom.â€</p>

<p>â€œOh ya, I totally forgot with all this cleaning to do.â€ Mom said suddenly remembering.</p>

<p>â€œWe will have to ask your Dad and Melanieâ€™s opinions tooâ€ Mom told Janice.</p>

<p>A Few Month Laterâ€¦â€¦  One day when Mom goes to check up, the doctor suggests that Mom stay in the hospital until the baby is born. Since Mom choose to stay, Janiceâ€™s aunt, aunt Juliana comes to stay so that she can help Mom and cook food for the others at home. Janiceâ€™s grandparents from her momâ€™s side lived in a city that was a little far from Janiceâ€™s house in Palatka,Florida so they came to stay too. Janice Grandparents from her Dadâ€™s side live only a few streets from their house so they can come anytime if needed.</p>

<p>One Saturday while Janice, Melanie,Dad, and Aunt Juliana were at church, a call came to tell them that the baby was about to be born! They quickly started driving toward the hospital. When they arrived, they were told to sit outside the room and wait for the baby.</p>

<p>Dad walked back and forth and so was Melanie. Aunt Juliana hurried to the room that Mom and the new baby were to stay in for a few days and do the best she can to make it comfortable and warm. Janice was simply sitting there waiting for her brother.</p>

<p>After a quick hour flew by, Mom and the baby came out. Mom had a big smile on her face and the baby was all wrapped up in blankets and was as peaceful as it could be. When Mom was strong enough and so was the baby after staying in the hospital for a few days they both came home.</p>

<p>Now, there was only one problem, sometimes in the night the babyâ€™s cry would make Janice awake and Melanie would flip on her bed while she was about to be asleep. But no matter what, it was a cute little brother all the time. The babyâ€™s first word was ma ma of course, but after a while it started to say Melanie which meant Melanie and Ja ice which meant Janice. Somehow, Mom forgot to buy enough milk powder one day so she made a no bong cod and milk soup that was ground up for the baby. He drank so happily and nearly drank up all the soup Mom made. It was sure that he likes cod.</p>

<p>That day after Dad got home from his work, Mom called Janice and Melanie and Dad together to discuss an important thing. â€œWhat do you guys think would be a nice name for the baby?â€ she asked.</p>

<p>Janice says Matt like she told Becki and Melanie want him to be called Samuel while Dad thinks William would be nice. Mom shared the story about how their baby loves cod. Then she said, â€œI think since he likes cod, why not call him Cody?â€ Everyone agrees on this name so the baby will now be little Cody.</p>

<h3 id="farm">Farm</h3>

<p>Janice and Melanieâ€™s grandparents from her mom side have a farm that is two and a half hours from Janiceâ€™s house. They would sometimes go for a visit on Saturday.</p>

<p>Today, they will be going to the farm. â€œMom, may my friend Charlotte come too?â€ Melanie asked.</p>

<p>â€œIâ€™m sure it will be fine. Where did she live?â€ Mom answered.</p>

<p>â€œOh, I never asked her that before. But I do remember her mentioning that she lives somewhere in Palm Valley.â€ Janice wanted to ask Mom if Becki could come, but as soon as she opened her mouth Mom said, â€œI know you want Becki to come, but if Charlotte was to come there wonâ€™t be any seat in the car for her.â€</p>

<p>Anyway, Janice was glad to visit her grandparents. When they get into the car, Cody sleeps on Momâ€™s knee while Dad drives the car and Charlotte, Melanie, and Janice will sit at the back. When Mom arrived at Charlotteâ€™s home which Melanie found out to be 184, Charlotte was right at the door. â€œI thought you would be coming soon. I got you a new best friend bracelet.â€ Charlotte said as she came rushing forward.</p>
